abstract = {This paper challenges the widely held view in the industrial organization literature that patents always speed up technological progress. We introduce a model of an innovating firm with uncertain property right to its innovation. The impact of a commitment to an R&D project is to create future options for patenting and market introduction. Each decision undertaken will change the conditions in which the innovator operates. It is shown that an increase in patent protection reduces the elasticity of the option value of the program with respect to the value of the project, raising the threshold value of market introduction and enhancing the ability of the innovator to wait. Thus, while the effect of patent is to raise the rents on and thereby the potential amount of innovations, it also tends to slow down market introduction.}
